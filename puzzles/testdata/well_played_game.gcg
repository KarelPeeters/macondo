#note C: this was a table 1 game, yay!
#note A: definitely a mistake. I should have played it at H4. #mindgameslarge

#note okras is the play here. even though RS > NS, the difference is small on this board, and OKRAS gives back enough fewer points from that overlap that it's worth it. i'm still sad about playing KOANS instead of KAONS, which sims half a point higher. it's a tiny difference, but it had a huge effect, and that's why it's important to make as few errors as possible. it seems impossible to get rid of all these little leaks. -1 #tacticssmall #knowledgesmall

#note i saw UNROOT at M3 but i didn't like it that much. i'm down a bit over a tempo and there's only a couple of lamish bingo lanes open. UNROOT sets up some overlap possibilities for him. it didn't seem that exciting. but maybe it's right. TAUON gives back 6 more pts on average. -4 #strategymedium

#note N2 OOHED is best. I think I saw N2 OOH and N3 OHO but nothing else. #findinglarge
>Cesar: ACELOQS 4L Q.A +24 309
#note blocking EQUAL was brutal. i really don't want to play QI J11. it blocks row 11 (which was already very difficult to hit, so maybe that's not a big deal) but most importantly leaves just one bingo lane open during an obvious fish. it just doesn't score, and doesn't hit that many things, i don't know. there's two Ds, three Is and a Y out, so QUA is going to get hit like all the time. but maybe that'll distract him and i'll draw a bingo and then the blank? blah.

#note C: ugh RET? out of that poolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
#note A: Apparently 15A ThEATER is best. #strategysmall although Quackle is bad at pre-endgames
>Cesar: AFFIIPW C10 WAFFI. +30 407
#note C: probably not the best pre-endgame.
#note A: Don't trust Quackle when there is still a tile in the bag. I did some math, and it appears that this is the best pre-endgame, guaranteeing an out with 5/8 unseen tiles (EORTY). 11C WAFFIE does slightly better with EOV but significantly worse with IUY, and is thus overall worse than C10 WAFFIE; nothing else comes close.
