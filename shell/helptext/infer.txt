infer [options] - Perform a tile inference

Example:
    infer
    infer -threads 3
    infer details
    infer log

Inference requires a game to be loaded. It tries to infer what tiles the
last person to make a move kept. The only allowed move types for inference
at this moment are "exchange" and "tile play".

That is, the last move must be an exchange or a tile play in order for
inference to work.

Inference will return an error if the move was not one of these two types,
or if there was no previous move. If the bag was empty when the player
made the move, it also does not bother inferring.

In order to set the rack of the player who is performing the inference,
so that the player whose rack is being inferred doesn't get assigned this
rack, just set it in the game using the "rack" option.

When the inferrer is done running, it prints out stats for the tiles. 

Inferences are saved in memory. You can sim using these inferences. 
See `help sim` or do `sim -useinferences cycle`.

Optional arguments:
    `infer log` will log to a temporary file.

    `infer details` shows a bit more details about the inference, including
    per-tile counts.

Options:

    -threads 3

    More threads means a more accurate inference. If not set, this number 
    defaults to the greater or 1 or your number of CPUs minus 1.

    -time 5

    The amount of time in seconds to infer. Defaults to 5 seconds. You may
    want this to be a little bit larger on slower machines / those with 
    fewer cores.

    -logfile /path/to/logfile

    Log inference to a logfile.
