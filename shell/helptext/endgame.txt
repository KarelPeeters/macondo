endgame [options] - solve endgame exhaustively

Example:

    endgame   
    endgame -plies 25   
    endgame -plies 25 -maxtime 120

About:

    Macondo uses minimax search to solve an endgame - i.e. it can exhaustively
    try all possible options for both players down a tree of plays. It uses 
    alpha-beta pruning, which is a way to stop searching branches of the tree
    when it becomes clear they can't possibly do better than other branches.

    For a large number of endgames, minimax search will finish rapidly and this
    will be a good approach. For more complex endgames, for example involving
    1-tile plays, or blanks, the tree will be very wide and the endgame algorithm
    will be very slow.

    We use iterative deepening, which allows you to get a decent answer very
    quickly, and with further time, this answer will be improved, as the algorithm
    looks further down the tree. So for even these very complex endgames, it is likely
    that you will get a good answer after a few seconds or minutes.

    The recommended way to call this is something akin to:

        endgame -plies 25 -maxtime 300

    This will make sure the algorithm uses at most 5 minutes of search. 
    It is also possible that the 25 plies will be reached before the time
    limit, depending on the complexity of the endgame.

Options:
    -plies 25 

    The above option will look 25 plies deep. As plies go up, the endgame
    solver often allocates and takes exponentially longer. However, there 
    are exceptions, especially if the endgame doesn't have many choices,
    or if we are deeper into the endgame where each player only has a few tiles
    left. In this case it is possible that the latter plies will be searched
    very fast, because there is nothing else to search.

    -maxtime 120

    This option will set a maximum time in seconds. The endgame solver uses
    iterative deepening by default, so a good enough solution should be found
    rapidly, and this solution will be improved upon.

    -disable-id true

    This option disables iterative deepening. Iterative Deepening allows the 
    endgame algorithm to check depth 1, 2, 3, etc plies successively. If you 
    are time-limited, it is likely that the first few answers will be good
    enough for many endgames.

    -complex-estimator true

    This option will turn on the complex estimator. By default, the endgame
    solver has an estimator that takes into account plays that are blocked and
    does some hand-wavy math to try to rank plays. It is very important in an
    alpha-beta minimax search to try to estimate the values of plays accurately.

    However, in practice, the complex estimator often takes a significantly longer time
    to run and doesn't provide a good enough benefit. It may be possible that some
    endgames are solved a lot faster with this estimator though. It is worth
    trying on endgames where someone is stuck with a tile.
